I have created a note taker application that allows users to stay organized with note taking.

You are able to add notes, save notes, delete notes.

I used express as my server.

I used apiRoute.js and htmlRoute.js for routes to respective places.

The app shows up and runs on a webpage thanks to index.html and notes.html.

This application allows users to create and save notes.

This application allows users to view previously saved notes.

This application allows users to delete previously saved notes.
